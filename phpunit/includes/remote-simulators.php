/**
 * Set up on a remote server for the HTTP tests.
 *
 * This file is intended to be symlinked as a MU plugin on the site being tested. It
 * will allow the test in question to handle remote requests from the PHPUnit tests.
 * This basically enables the test site to handle those requests by simulating a
 * particular environment. Exactly which simulator is run is determined by the
 * `x-wordpoints-tests-simulator` request header.
 *
 * This is useful when running tests on code that performs requests to a remote site.
 * By utilizing this simulator, an actual request to an environment simulating the
 * actual remote environment can be made. This is more realistic than simply mocking
 * the response that might be returned, because it allows the same code that would
 * respond on that remote environment to simulate and return the response from the
 * local test site.
 *
 * Essentially, we simulate a local version of a remote environment, that we can then
 * make "remote" requests to in our tests.
